Color Picker
===========

Ever got frustrated with wanting to know what color something is but have to do it the long way - take screenshot, paste into Paint, use Color picker?

Clients send you a PSD or JPEG with their design but finding all the colors takes too long?

Well this just takes out all these excessive steps and let you easily find the color you're looking for.
* Run the application - it adds a new Icon in your tray
* Left click on the icon to bring up the overlay
* This overlay can be closed by right-clicking
* Use mouse left button to drag a rectangle
* The rectangle has a maximum size because it will be zoomed
* After creating the rectangle a window will popup with this region zoomed
* Now left-click (or hold left button and move mouse) to pick an exact pixel to get the color for
* This will (once the right-mouse is released) show a window where you can copy the HEX or RGB value
* The app can be closed via the icon's right-click menu
